# The End
This is a mini app using VueJS to handle some of the routes and databinding. ( I have been itching to find something to build in Vue!!)

Like the other two, you can get this repo by either cloning it or downloading the zip. Run `npm install` to get all the packages. And run `npm run dev` when the packages are installed. I changed the scripts a little bit because of the added complexity.

There is a gulp task starting a local server and running the code. That also starts the browser and refreshes any changes that are made. ( Gulp + BrowserSync is a beautiful thing. If you do not know about it, GO LEARN ABOUT IT NOW! You will thank me later. )

All of this is written in vanilla JavaScript and it's using ES6 and later API's. Be sure to run this in evergreen browsers. Latest Chrome or FireFox should work just fine.

*The Fetch API does not work in or < IE 11 or < Safari 10 so avoid those for the example. (CanIUse)[http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch]*
